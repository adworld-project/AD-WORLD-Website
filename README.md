## Problem
Digitised newspaper collections in Britain and around the world comprise vast datasets containing
both text and images of incalculable value. Researchers have only just begun to make use of these
collections in ways that make use of data science methods. This is partly because of intractable
technical challenges of wrangling and pre-processing the material. And those researchers who have
begun to work on these collections have focused exclusively on the ‘news’ content of the papers.
However, of equal, or perhaps even greater, value is the goldmine of information contained in
advertisements. Adverts are an untapped resource for understanding culture, society and the
economy, which remain inaccessible to researchers working ‘at scale’. And these datasets continue
to grow at pace, with millions of new scans being created daily among the many heritage
digitisation initiatives underway around the world.

## Significance
For domain experts across a range of historical fields – from economists and social scientists to art
historians – access to large datasets of adverts offer the prospect of whole new vistas, never
previously imaginable. Information about consumer goods, labour markets, prices, visual culture,
transportation and housing – at high resolution and granularity, filtered geographically, by date,
publication, and type of advert – promises entirely new research in those domains.
In addition, developing a computational research agenda for adverts is an opportunity to
tackle multiple data- and method-related issues of current interest to data science and A.I.
researchers. Adverts on newspaper pages are notoriously difficult for existing methods to identify
and segment correctly, much less classify. One reason is that adverts take many forms: such
diversity within the genre is an opportunity to develop new CV methods that can approach the
newspaper page as a complex, multi-modal object where adverts contain text, illustrations, or both
at once. The fundamental complexity and variation within these materials demand innovation that
begins with historical knowledge and leads to generalisable data science approaches to these vast
(and growing) collections.

## Current state of the art
The prospect of multimodal A.I. – for example, OpenAI’s CLIP and DALL-E – is creating huge public
interest in the power of combining text and image. At the same time, current research is addressing
the challenges of wrangling difficult historical documents, in disparate places. Scholars in Belgium
and the Netherlands have explored using CV on newspapers as well as other document types; in
Germany, ML-equipped librarians have led the way on problems of layout and segmentation. In the
US, work on newspaper collections has led to new interfaces for visual search. Some of this work
has tentatively engaged with multi-modal techniques, but bringing such methods to bear on historical sources remains at the embryonic stage. 
Our aim in this workshop is to bring colleagues together to share findings and insight about the most effective way to leverage cutting-edge
methods in tackling these generic challenges, focusing in the first instance on this one specific
source type; namely, adverts, which will be of great interest to many historical researchers.
